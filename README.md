# get-started-with-redux-lesson17
This is based on the lessons from https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux, lesson 17, just so there's something to compare with and see how the code should be. It will get more complicated soon

I've been going through a crazy number of started kits first for flux and then we discovered the genius of REDUX by Dan Abramov. 
But then towards the last 6 or 7 lessons it seemed to become harder to have some reference of the code. 

So I decided to just follow the videos and create working versions of the entire code from Dan's lessons. 

I plan to create repos for lessons after 17 because that's where he talks about the Connect, MapStateToProps etc, which I didn't 
find to be intuitive initially. Hence I am on this journey to document the evolution of the code through the lessons as I get ready to create
a full production scale app with React + Redux. 

For this code, I used the Counter example from inside the examples folder of the redux repo and modified it to show a running version of lesson 17

Hope people find this useful!
